    <h1>The United Kingdom</h1>

<p>Living just north of London was perfect, as we were close enough to train into London for the day, but also had easy access to the M1 and M25.
We could easily drive anywhere, and also had a train line passing directly through the town.</p>

<p>We tried to travel every weekend, and some of our highlights are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>St Alban's Cathedral<br>
<br>This was our local cathedral, and is the site of the longest continuing Christian worship in the UK.

<li>Tower Bridge, London<br>
<br>This iconic old bridge is located right next to the Tower of London. We climbed across the top and were directly above the bridge when it opened up to allow boats through on the Queen's jubilee.</li>
</ul>
